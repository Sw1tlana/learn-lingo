# üåê Online Language Tutors

## Project Description
This project is a web application for a company that offers online language tutoring services. The application consists of three main pages:
- **"Home"**
- **"Teachers"**
- **"Favorites"**

These pages provide users with access to information about tutors, their advantages, and the opportunity to choose the best tutor for language learning.

## Main Technologies

**React**: for creating the user interface.  
**Firebase**: for implementing the database (Realtime Database) and user authentication.  
**React Hook Form**: for form validation during registration and authentication.  
**Yup**: for validating data schemas in forms.  
**Styled Components**: for styling components according to the mockup.
## Mockup
The mockup of the application can be found [here](link_to_mockup). The styling is implemented considering the examples provided in the mockup, with unique variations of the color palette.

## Technical Task
### Main Functionalities:
1. **Authentication**: The user authentication functionality (registration, login, logout) is implemented using Firebase.
2. **Form Validation**: React Hook Form and Yup are used to validate the registration/authentication fields.
3. **Database**: A collection of tutors has been created in the Realtime Database with the following fields:
   - `name`
   - `surname`
   - `languages`
   - `levels`
   - `rating`
   - `reviews`
   - `price_per_hour`
   - `lessons_done`
   - `avatar_url`
   - `lesson_info`
   - `conditions`
   - `experience`
   
   The collection is populated using the `teachers.json` file.

4. **Tutor Card**: A card describing the characteristics of the tutor has been implemented according to the mockup.
5. **Loading Cards**: On the "Teachers" page, 4 cards are rendered, and more can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button.
6. **Favorite Tutors**:
   - **For Unauthorized Users**: A modal window or push notification about functionality limitations.
   - **For Authorized Users**: Adding tutors to the favorites list with state persistence upon page refresh.
7. **Detailed Information**: Clicking the "Read more" button expands the card to show more details.
8. **Booking a Trial Lesson**: Clicking the "Book trial lesson" button opens a modal window with a booking form.
9. **Private "Favorites" Page**: Available only to authorized users to view their favorite tutors.

## Installation and Running
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
